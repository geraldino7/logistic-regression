# logistic-regression

A basic machine learning approach that is frequently used for binary classification tasks is called logistic regression. Though its name suggests otherwise, it uses the sigmoid function to simulate the likelihood of an instance falling into a specific class, producing values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression, with its emphasis on interpretability, simplicity, and efficient computation, is widely applied in a variety of fields, such as marketing, finance, and healthcare, and it offers insightful forecasts and useful information for decision-making.
